# Maze-Solving Game TODO Checklist

## 1. Project Setup
- [x] **Folder Structure**
  - [x] Create project directory.
  - [x] Create `index.html`.
  - [x] Create `styles.css`.
  - [x] Create `main.js`.

- [ ] **HTML Setup**
  - [x] Link the p5.js library.
  - [x] Link `main.js` and `styles.css`.
  - [x] Add a container element for the canvas.

- [x] **CSS Setup**
  - [x] Basic styling for page layout.
  - [x] Ensure canvas container is centered and sized correctly.

- [ ] **p5.js Initialization**
  - [ ] Set up a 500×500 canvas in `main.js`.
  - [ ] Display a test message (e.g., “Hello, Canvas!”) on the canvas.

## 2. Maze Generation Module
- [x] **Define Maze Data Structure**
  - [x] Represent the maze as a grid of cells.
  - [x] Each cell should store wall data (top, right, bottom, left).

- [x] **Grid Initialization**
  - [x] Create a function to initialize the grid for a given maze size.
  - [x] Validate the grid dimensions based on input maze size.

- [x] **DFS Maze Generation Algorithm**
  - [x] Implement DFS with backtracking to carve passages.
  - [x] Ensure the algorithm always produces a solvable maze.
  - [x] Log or test that the maze is correctly generated.

## 3. Maze Rendering with p5.js
- [ ] **Rendering Function**
  - [ ] Write a function to draw the maze on the canvas.
  - [ ] Calculate cell size dynamically to fit the 500×500 canvas.
  - [ ] Draw walls in black and the background in white.

- [ ] **Visual Testing**
  - [ ] Render a generated maze to verify correctness.
  - [ ] Confirm that wall thickness and alignment are consistent.

## 4. Player Movement Implementation
- [ ] **Player Object**
  - [ ] Create a player object (green dot) with an initial position.
  - [ ] Ensure starting position is near one side of the maze.

- [ ] **Event Listeners**
  - [ ] Set up key event listeners for arrow keys.
  - [ ] Verify that key events are correctly captured.

- [ ] **Movement Logic**
  - [ ] Move the player one cell at a time in cardinal directions.
  - [ ] Check for walls and only allow valid moves.
  - [ ] Log movement events to validate behavior.

## 5. Win Condition and Game Loop
- [ ] **Finish Square**
  - [ ] Define and render a finish square (red) on the opposite side.
  
- [ ] **Win Detection**
  - [ ] Implement logic to detect when the player reaches the finish.
  - [ ] Display a “You win!” message on win detection.

- [ ] **Countdown and Maze Reset**
  - [ ] Start a 5-second countdown after winning.
  - [ ] Disable player movement during the countdown.
  - [ ] After the countdown, clear the current maze.
  - [ ] Generate a new maze, increasing the size by 10 cells (up to 100×100).
  - [ ] Log and test the entire game loop.

## 6. Difficulty Slider and UI Enhancements
- [ ] **Difficulty Slider**
  - [ ] Add an HTML slider (range input) for maze size (50×50 to 200×200).
  - [ ] Style the slider appropriately in CSS.

- [ ] **Slider Event Handling**
  - [ ] On slider change, clear the current maze.
  - [ ] Display a “Generating new maze…” message.
  - [ ] Hide the slider during the 5-second countdown.
  - [ ] Generate and render the new maze after the countdown.
  - [ ] Re-display the slider after new maze generation.

- [ ] **Win Counter**
  - [ ] Add a win counter display.
  - [ ] Update the win counter each time the player wins.

## 7. Debugging Tools and Testing
- [ ] **Instant Completion Tool**
  - [ ] Implement a tool or button to instantly trigger the win condition.
  - [ ] Test that the instant win tool properly bypasses normal gameplay.

- [ ] **Edge Case Testing**
  - [ ] Test rapid key presses to ensure only the latest is processed.
  - [ ] Test slider changes during active countdown.
  - [ ] Log debugging information for maze generation, rendering, and movement.

## 8. Final Integration and Polishing
- [ ] **Module Integration**
  - [ ] Wire together maze generation, rendering, player movement, and win condition.
  - [ ] Ensure UI elements (slider, win counter, messages) are properly linked with game logic.

- [ ] **Code Cleanup**
  - [ ] Refactor code for clarity and maintainability.
  - [ ] Add inline comments and documentation.
  - [ ] Remove any test logs or temporary code before final deployment.

- [ ] **Final Testing**
  - [ ] Run full integration tests of the game.
  - [ ] Verify that the game behaves as expected under various scenarios.
  - [ ] Ensure no orphaned or unintegrated code remains.

- [ ] **Documentation**
  - [ ] Update README with installation, usage, and testing instructions.
  - [ ] Document known issues and potential future enhancements.
